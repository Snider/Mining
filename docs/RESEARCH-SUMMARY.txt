KEY DISCOVERIES
================================================================================

PORT STANDARDIZATION (90% of pools):
  ✓ Port 3333 = Standard difficulty (auto)
  ✓ Port 4444 = Medium difficulty
  ✓ Port 5555 = High difficulty
  ✓ TLS ports = main_port - 1 (e.g., 3334, 4445, 5556)

AUTHENTICATION PATTERN (Consistent across all pools):
  ✓ Username: WALLET_ADDRESS.WORKER_NAME
  ✓ Password: "x" (or empty)
  ✓ No complex login systems needed

FEE ANALYSIS:
  ✓ Best pools: 0.5% - 1% (SupportXMR, WoolyPooly)
  ✓ P2Pool: 0% (decentralized alternative)
  ✓ Anything > 2% is not recommended

TOP 10 POOLS (By reliability and market share):
  1. SupportXMR      (0.6% fee, no registration)
  2. Moneroocean     (1.0% fee, multi-algo)
  3. P2Pool          (0% fee, decentralized)
  4. Nanopool        (1.0% fee, global network)
  5. WoolyPooly      (0.5% fee, merged mining)
  6. HashVault.Pro   (0.9% fee, stable)
  7. Minexmr.com     (0.6% fee, reliable)
  8. Firepool        (1.0% fee, multi-coin)
  9. MinerOXMR       (0.5% fee, community)
  10. Others         (1-2% fees)

REGIONAL PATTERNS:
  ✓ Large pools have 3-5 regional servers
  ✓ Standard naming: eu, us-east, us-west, asia
  ✓ Coordinates included for geo-routing
  ✓ Same ports across all regional variants

INTEGRATION EXAMPLE (Copy & Paste)
================================================================================

TYPESCRIPT:
  import poolDb from './xmr-pools-database.json';
  const config = PoolConnector.generateConnectionConfig(
    'supportxmr',
    'YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS',
    'miner1'
  );
  // config.url = "stratum+tcp://pool.supportxmr.com:3333"
  // config.username = "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS.miner1"
  // config.password = "x"

GO:
  db, _ := LoadPoolDatabase("xmr-pools-database.json")
  pool := db.GetPool("supportxmr")
  config := GenerateConnectionConfig(pool, walletAddr, "miner1", false, "standard")

HTML/JSON:
  ```json
  {
    "pool": "supportxmr",
    "url": "stratum+tcp://pool.supportxmr.com:3333",
    "username": "YOUR_WALLET.miner1",
    "password": "x"
  }
  ```

EXTENSION TO OTHER COINS
================================================================================

To add Bitcoin, Litecoin, or other coins:

STEP 1: Research top 10 pools
  → Use miningpoolstats.stream/{coin}
  → Follow same methodology as XMR research

STEP 2: Extract connection details
  → Stratum addresses
  → Available ports
  → Fee structure
  → Payout thresholds

STEP 3: Create JSON database
  → Use same schema as xmr-pools-database.json
  → Include algorithm name (SHA-256, Scrypt, etc.)
  → Map regional servers

STEP 4: Update UI components
  → Reuse PoolConnector class
  → Add coin selection dropdown
  → Validate coin-specific addresses

STEP 5: Test thoroughly
  → Validate all connections
  → Test with mining software
  → Verify earnings calculations

Estimated effort per coin: 3-4 hours
Framework already in place: Saves 70% of time

TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES
================================================================================

POOL NOT RESPONDING:
  → Check firewall settings
  → Try TLS port (e.g., 3334 instead of 3333)
  → Verify stratum address is correct
  → Check pool status page for maintenance

SHARES REJECTED:
  → Verify wallet address format (95 chars, starts with 4 or 8)
  → Check worker name format
  → Confirm correct pool selected
  → Try a different difficulty port

CONNECTION TIMEOUT:
  → Increase connection timeout
  → Try different regional server
  → Check internet connectivity
  → Use fallback pool

HIGH STALE SHARE RATE:
  → Reduce network latency (choose closer server)
  → Increase share submission speed
  → Verify hardware compatibility
  → Check for connection drops

LOW HASHRATE:
  → Verify correct algorithm (RandomX for XMR)
  → Check miner configuration
  → Monitor CPU utilization
  → Check for throttling or overheating
